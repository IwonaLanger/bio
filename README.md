## About

I am a graduate of the **English Philology Department** at the **[University of Silesia](https://us.edu.pl)** with long experience in teaching English to all age groups. Although, as an English teacher, I have had multiple opportunities of personal and professional development, I am now looking for a position that will offer new challenges and a possibility to learn new skills.  
  
I have successfully used the **[Scrum](https://www.scrum.org)** framework in my teaching experience and I find it very interesting. Therefore, I would appreciate the opportunity of further development and working in this area as well.
